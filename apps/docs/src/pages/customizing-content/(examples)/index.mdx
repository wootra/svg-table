## Table With Custom Element <GitHubLink demoName="BasicWithElement" is:inline />

you can add an SVG Element as you want. Its position will start from left-top if you don't use callback function.

<div className='demo-container'>
	<BasicWithElement />
</div>

## Custom Element With Props <GitHubLink demoName="BasicWithProps" is:inline />

Do you want to adjust the element based on the center position? No problem! Use callback function.

<div className='demo-container'>
	<BasicWithProps />
</div>

## Allow Contents Overflow <GitHubLink demoName="BasicWithPropsAllowingOverflow" is:inline />

For the clean look and feel, the default behavior of the cell does not allow overflow of the content. But you can set them to allow overflow with one line. This is useful for debugging. (You know, content is hiding and have no idea where it is...)

<div className='demo-container'>
	<BasicWithPropsAllowingOverflow />
</div>

## Control Overflow behavior individually <GitHubLink demoName="BasicWithPropsAllowingOverflowOnlyOneCell" is:inline />

You can make only some cell to overflow as well.
This allow you to control the table look granually.

<div className='demo-container'>
	<BasicWithPropsAllowingOverflowOnlyOneCell />
</div>



## Text Position Adjustment <GitHubLink demoName="TextPositionAdjustment" is:inline />

if your usecase is simply adjusting a little text position based from the center of the cell,
you can use cx, cy

<div className='demo-container'>
	<TextPositionAdjustment />
</div>



## Outbound Labels <GitHubLink demoName="OutboundLabels" is:inline />

If you want to put labels outside of the table area, you might find it is very hard.
You can add before and after items to make outbound labels easily.

<div className='demo-container'>
	<OutboundLabels />
</div>


## Background and Text Color change <GitHubLink demoName="BgColorAndTextColor" is:inline />

You can change background of the cells and table.
If you want to even more customize it, you can add some defs
through props. In this example, You will see gradients.
You can also change the text color simply.


<div className='demo-container'>
	<BgColorAndTextColor />
</div>



## Text override <GitHubLink demoName="TextStyleOverride" is:inline />

svg-table has class names for individual elements. so you can add css.
but also, you can control individual text's attributes since the attributes are passed by `style.textStyle` option. All possible attributes can be passed to text elements.

using this behavior, we can override text's position, layout, and much more behavior.

in this example, I just overrode the positions of text.

<div className='demo-container'>
	<TextStyleOverride />
</div>
